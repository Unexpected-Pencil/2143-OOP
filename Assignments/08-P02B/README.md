## Program 2B - Class design

### Jacob Lawler

### The purpose of this assignment is to design a set of classes for a digital version of the game Knucklebones. The goal of this assignment is to organize your ideas and determine the relationships between different components of the game, such as players, dice, and the game itself. I also determine when to use composition and inheritance.
