## Definitions

#### Abstract Classes and Interfaces
> Abstract classes and interfaces are both used in object-oriented programming (OOP) to create maintainable code. They are both abstraction mechanisms that help separate components and define contracts for classes. Abstract Classes are classes with atleast one virtual method whereas a abstract interface is a class with only virtual methods.
#### Abstraction 
>  The process of hiding complex details and only showing the necessary features of an object. This makes it easier to interact with objects, which can make programming more efficient and intuitive. 
#### Access Modifiers (Public, Private, Protected)
> Access modifiers are keywords in object-oriented programming languages that control the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. They are part of the syntax of a programming language and are used to help encapsulate components.
>>
>>  A public access modifier allows access to a class, method, or variable from any other class in an application, regardless of the package. 
>>
>> A private access modifier is a type of access control that limits access to a member of a class to only within that class or by friend classes. 
>>
>> A protected access modifier is a way to control access to a class's members, allowing them to be accessed by subclasses or friend classes.
#### Attributes/Properties
> Attributes or properties in object-oriented programming are defined for classes and objects such as a data element representing the quality or state of the class or object. Attributes are typically 
#### Class
>  A class is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for objects, attributes, and methods.
#### Class Variables
> In class-based, object-oriented programming, a class variable is a variable defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist. 
#### Collections and Iterators 
> In computer programming, a collection is a group of objects.
> An iterator is an object that allows access to each object of a collection.
#### Constructors
> A constructor is a function in object-oriented programming that prepares a new object for use. Constructors are automatically called when an object is created, and they assign values to the object's members.
#### Destructors 
> A destructor is a member function that is automatically called when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. Destructors are used to deallocate memory and perform other cleanup tasks for a class object and its members.
#### Design Patterns
> The core design principles of oop are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
#### Diamond Problem
> An ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method in A that B and C have overridden, and D does not override it, then which version of the method does D inherit: that of B, or that of C?

#### Encapsulation 
> Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data with the methods that operate on it. It's used to hide the values of a structured data object within a class, preventing unauthorized access. 
#### Exception Handling
> Exceptions are runtime anomalies or abnormal conditions that a program encounters during its execution. The process of handling these exceptions is called exception handling. Using the exception handling mechanism, the control from one part of the program where the exception occurred can be transferred to another part of the code.
#### File I/O in OOP 
> In object-oriented programming (OOP), "File I/O" refers to the process of reading data from or writing data to a file on a computer using object-oriented techniques, where you typically create classes that encapsulate file operations like opening, reading, writing, and closing, allowing for a structured and reusable way to manage data interaction with files.
#### Friend Keyword
> In C++, the friend keyword is used to grant a function or another class access to the private and protected members of the class in which it is declared.
#### Generics
> The simple idea is to pass the data type as a parameter so that we donâ€™t need to write the same code for different data types. For example, a software company may need to sort() for different data types. Rather than writing and maintaining multiple codes, we can write one sort() and pass the datatype as a parameter. 
#### Inheritance
> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It's a way to create a hierarchy of classes that share attributes and methods, and it's based on a hierarchical relationship between classes. 
#### Instance Variable
> An instance variable is a variable that is defined within a class, but each object of that class has its own copy of the variable.
#### Member Variable
> A member variable, also known as an instance variable or data member, is a variable that is declared within a class and is accessible by all methods of that class. Member variables are associated with a specific object and maintain their values for the lifetime of that object. 
#### Memory Management (Garbage Collection, Pointers)
>The process of defining and handling data associated with an object within a class, including attributes (member variables) and the methods (member functions) that operate on that data, ensuring proper encapsulation and access control to manage the object's state and behavior effectively.
>> Garbage collection is an automated process where the runtime environment identifies and reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced by the program, essentially cleaning up unused object data to prevent memory leaks and optimize memory usage; it works by tracking object references and removing objects that have no active pointers pointing to them, allowing the memory to be reused for new objects. 
>>
>> A pointer is an object in programming languages that stores a memory address. Pointers are used to store the addresses of other variables or memory items. They are essential for dynamic memory allocation and are often used in parameter passing. 
#### Method
> A method is a procedure or behavior associated with an object. Methods are similar to functions, subroutines, or algorithms, and can include programming components like for loops and while loops. Methods can manipulate the attributes of an object.
#### Method Overloading 
> Method overloading is a type of polymorphism, which is the ability of objects or methods to behave differently depending on how they are used. In method overloading, methods are differentiated by the number and type of parameters passed to them.
#### Multiple Inheritance
> Multiple inheritance is a feature in some object-oriented programming languages that allows a class or object to inherit from more than one parent class or object. This is different from single inheritance, where a class or object can only inherit from one parent class or object.
#### Multithreading in OOP (time permitting)
> Multithreading is a programming concept that allows a single process to run multiple threads simultaneously. In object-oriented programming (OOP), multithreading can be used to create shared safe objects.
#### Objects 
> An object is a specific instance of a class that contains real values instead of variables.
#### Object Relationships (Association, Aggregation, Composition)
#### Operator Overloading
#### Overloading
#### Polymorphism
#### SOLID Principles 
#### Static (Methods and Variables)
#### Templates
#### Testing in OOP (Unit Testing, Test-Driven Development)
#### UML Diagrams and Modeling
> Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language. The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been designed. It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering. UML is not a programming language, it is rather a visual language.
#### Virtual
> The virtual keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration so that it can be overridden in a derived class.
