## Definitions

#### Abstract Classes and Interfaces
> Abstract classes and interfaces are both used in object-oriented programming (OOP) to create maintainable code. They are both abstraction mechanisms that help separate components and define contracts for classes. Abstract Classes are classes with atleast one virtual method whereas a abstract interface is a class with only virtual methods.
#### Abstraction 
>  The process of hiding complex details and only showing the necessary features of an object. This makes it easier to interact with objects, which can make programming more efficient and intuitive. 
#### Access Modifiers (Public, Private, Protected)
> Access modifiers are keywords in object-oriented programming languages that control the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. They are part of the syntax of a programming language and are used to help encapsulate components.
>>
>>  A public access modifier allows access to a class, method, or variable from any other class in an application, regardless of the package. 
>>
>> A private access modifier is a type of access control that limits access to a member of a class to only within that class or by friend classes. 
>>
>> A protected access modifier is a way to control access to a class's members, allowing them to be accessed by subclasses or friend classes.
#### Attributes/Properties
> Attributes or properties in object-oriented programming are defined for classes and objects such as a data element representing the quality or state of the class or object. Attributes are typically 
#### Class
>  A class is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for objects, attributes, and methods.
#### Class Variables
> In class-based, object-oriented programming, a class variable is a variable defined in a class of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist. 
#### Collections and Iterators 
> In computer programming, a collection is a group of objects.
> An iterator is an object that allows access to each object of a collection.
#### Constructors
> A constructor is a function in object-oriented programming that prepares a new object for use. Constructors are automatically called when an object is created, and they assign values to the object's members.
#### Destructors 
> A destructor is a member function that is automatically called when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. Destructors are used to deallocate memory and perform other cleanup tasks for a class object and its members.
#### Design Patterns
> Encapsulation
> 
> Inheritance
> 
> Polymorphism
#### Diamond Problem
>
#### Encapsulation 
> Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data with the methods that operate on it. It's used to hide the values of a structured data object within a class, preventing unauthorized access.
